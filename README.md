# TMNIST Alphabet Character Classification

## Overview
This repository contains a tutorial for developing and training a neural network to classify handwritten characters from the TMNIST Alphabet dataset, which includes 94 distinct characters. The tutorial covers everything from setting up the environment to training and evaluating the model using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Dataset
The TMNIST Alphabet dataset is a collection of 281,000 grayscale images of 28x28 pixel resolution, representing one of 94 characters. It includes numbers, lowercase and uppercase letters, and special characters.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Installation
Clone this repository and install the required packages using:

\```bash
